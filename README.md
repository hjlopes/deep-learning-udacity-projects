# Deep Learning Nanodegree project solutions

Hi! This is repository for my solutions of the [Udacity Nanodegree Deep Learning course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).
You can find the original projects code [in their repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch).


Navigate to each project folder to find the solutions:

1. [Bike Sharing project](project-bikesharing/Your_first_neural_network.ipynb) - Project to create a Fully Connected network to estimate bike sharing usage using data from University of Porto. 
2. [Dog Breed Classifier](project-dog-breed-classification) - Project to create a dog breed classifier using a CNN built from scratch and transfer learning.
3. [TV Script Generation](project-tv-script-generation) - Project use LSTM networks to generate TV scripts based on the Seinfeld tv show scripts. 
4. [Face Generation](project-face-generation) - Project to generate faces using GANs.
5. [SageMaker Sentiment Analysis](project-sagemaker-sentiment) - Deployment in Amazon AWS SageMaker of a Sentiment Analysis Model. 

## Project Instructions

Model checkpoints are not included in the repository. You will have to execute the code to generate yourself.

Some data, due to its size, is also not included. Download from the README links that are in the respective folders!
