### Project Repository Overview

Hi! This is repository for my solutions of the Udacity Deep Learning course. Navigate to each project folder to find the solutions.

1. [Bike Sharing project](project-bikesharing/Your_first_neural_network.ipynb) - Project to create a Fully Connected network to estimate bike sharing usage using data from University of Porto. 
2. [Dog Breed Classifier](project-dog-breed-classification) - Project to create a dog breed classifier using a CNN built from scratch and transfer learning.
3. [TV Script generation](project-tv-script-generation) - Project use LSTM networks to generate TV scripts based on the Seinfeld tv show scripts. 

## Project Instructions

Model checkpoints are not included in the repository. You will have to execute the code to generate yourself.

Some data, due to its size is also not included. Download from the README links that are in the respective folders!
